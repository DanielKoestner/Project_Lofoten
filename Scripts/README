## This directory contains 4 scripts. ##

# i. Lofoten.m: A "tutorial" file for downloading and processing
# BGC-ARGO data. Requires OneArgo matlab package which is already
# part of the repository if you pulled these scripts through git

# ii. process_BGCARGO_BBP_CHL.m: A script to associate BBP700/CHLA from BGC-ARGO
# with small and large particles. Requires a .mat file in the directory "matfiles"
# that contains  two data structures: one for BBP700 and one for Chl. 
# In the script the default names of these structures are "Data_qc_Chl" and "Data_qc_BBP."
# They were obtained using the "qc_filter" function from the OneArgo package (the code can
# be found in Lofoten.m). The structures needed to be separated because we only want
# to use qc 1,2, or 8 data for CHLA but raw data for BBP700 (BBP700 is generally not qc'd).
# The structures can actually have any data so long as they have 
# a. "CHLA_ADJUSTED" (just the Chl data structure).
# b. "BBP700" (just the BBP data structure).
# c. "PRES_ADJUSTED" (just the BBP data structure).


# iii. Koest23_modelB_700.m: Script for converting BBP700/chla to POC by Daniel Koestner

# iv. Koest23_Lofoten_Map_POC.m/Koest23_Lofoten_Map_bs_bl.m: scripts to visualizing 
# small (bs) and large (bl) particle-associated BBP700 and Chla (Koest23_Lofoten_Map_bs_bl.m), as well as small and large
# POC (Koest23_Lofoten_Map_POC.m). For the latter, also calls Koest23_modelB_700.m to convert
# BBP700/Chla to POC.
